<h1>5 reasons why you should have an amuzzin account</h1>

<p>We have officially launched amuzzin three days before and we have few <strong>genuine</strong> users. We are really happy for their adventurous dive into our application, exploring each and every feature and providing us their valuble suggestions. Some suggestions are way beyond our scope, but I am sure we will get there :)</p>

<p>We would like to draw a clear line of what is not amuzzin before we start.</p>

<h4>amuzzin is a complete music repostiroy</h4>

<p><strong>No.</strong> If you search for your favourite song and if the search returns nothing please don&rsquo;t get dissapointed. amuzzin is user driven model wherein one user uploads a song and rest gets access to them. Please feel free to publish your song if you find it missing in our repository. The next person who searches the song will be grateful to you.</p>

<h4>amuzzin is yet another online music player</h4>

<p><strong>No.</strong> It is personalized and tailored for you, depending on your taste. It provides <strong>realtime</strong> updates on your uploaded song from all your friends. It also provides realtime music feed on your friends activities. So you stay tuned to them, with your tune playing.</p>

<h2>why you should have an amuzzin account</h2>

<h5>1. You might miss what your friends are currently playing</h5>

<blockquote><p>No friends, No fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the main inspiation behind amuzzin. A song in isolation is just a variation in amplitude and frequencies (and all other technical parameters to add on). When we hear some song we love, we recall a situation or a person or some external real life parameter which completes it. Most of the times it would be our <strong>friends</strong>.</p>

<p>We had several crappy ways in past like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Link Gtalk status to some music players (in worst case  changing it manually)</li>
<li>Spam people on Facebook with Listening to statuses</li>
<li>Tweet each and every song you play using #nowplaying</li>
</ul>


<p>This is how the world worked atleast for letting your friends know what you are currently listening to (which would annoy rest of the crowd).</p>

<p>We have a feature in amuzzin <strong>friends&#8217; stream</strong> which would list all your online friends, their currently playing songs and their entire Queue of Now Playing.</p>

<p>Whenever you signin using Facebook we sync all your facebook friends who are in amuzzin database. If you want to keep your facebook world out of the amuzzin world (since both serves entirely different purposes) you can manually search your close ones and add them selectively.</p>

<p>You can block anyone from friends&#8217; stream who might be a <strong>friend of a friend of a friend</strong> whom you accepted in Facebook accidentally and you don&rsquo;t wish to see in the friends&#8217; stream, by searching their name and clicking <strong>&lsquo;Hide from Stream&rsquo;</strong>.</p>

<h5>2. Add once, Play anywhere</h5>

<blockquote><p>Copying and synching is always pain. Let amuzzin handle that.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are like me, switching between PC&rsquo;s and laptops in Home and using a different system in Office you could organize it onetime and just login to amuzz.in elsewhere.</p>

<h5>3. You can upload your songs and promote it to wide user base</h5>

<blockquote><p>We are pleased to be your startup Board for your Music Career</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are a singer or a musician and would like to broadcast your talent to entire world (atleast to the amuzzin circle) this would the right place. Upload your song and keep track of Favourites, Comments, ratings etc., on your song after uploading. You can click <strong>Upload Songs</strong> anytime and upload the songs.</p>

<h5>4. You might miss whats happening around your friends circle</h5>

<blockquote><p>We are not replicating facebook. We are doing what is necessary for a music lover.</p></blockquote>

<p>We know the world is asynchronous, with different friends in different timezones.List of all the activities by your friends would appear as a timeline. We didn&rsquo;t try to replicate facebook, but when we completed this feature they resembled like twin sisters, Where one displays the whole  list of craps while other displays the feeds specific about music. We have this organized in a feature called <strong>music feed</strong>.</p>

<p> Explore this feature from here: <a href="http://amuzz.in/activities">http://amuzz.in/activities</a></p>

<h5>5. You might miss the songs which you would love</h5>

<blockquote><p>Algorithms are good slave but bad masters.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have tried an algorithm to recommend the songs you would love but you haven&rsquo;t heard depending on the Pitch,Frequency,Artist,Album,Users and all other details available about the song in match with you. This is still in alpha but we think this might help you explore more songs and will keep you always happy with diverse songs from our repository. We know algorithms are bad atleast in two things, deciding your music and your partner. We just provide you a path to explore new songs here, like a pinch of salt in your entire music dish.</p>

<p><code>P.S:</code> Our initial assumptions might be wrong, because it might be biased from our friends view. Please feel free to comment or provide your suggestions.</p>
