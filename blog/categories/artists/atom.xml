    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Publishing songs made easy with amuzzin</h1>

<p>We received few requests from budding artists on their need to upload their own Album Art and to edit the language, genre and lyrics of their song. We are glad we completed those features in the current release (28 Jan 2014).</p>

<h4>Pictures, pictures everywhere!</h4>

<p>Whenever we display your song in amuzzin, mostly it would result in displaying an boring <strong>&ldquo;No Image Available&rdquo;</strong> frame. This might happen because, your songs might lack an Album Art internally as specified by mp3 format.</p>

<p>We know pictures plays very important role in this multimedia era and it&rsquo;s more descriptive than any other form of media. If you got a perfect Album Art for your song, you are going to attract more music fans than your fellow artists.</p>

<h4>So how do I update my songs' Album Art?</h4>

<p>Very simple! Go to <strong>My Songs</strong> and click edit Icon on the appropriate song (now edit option appears on top right corner of each song). It would display three column page.</p>

<p>In the first column you would be viewing the old Album Art.</p>

<p>You can upload an album art in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have your Album Art in your PC then click <strong>choose file</strong>, locate your image file and upload it.</li>
<li>If you have an url which points your Album Art then copy paste the Remote Url in the appropriate field and click <strong>Save Song</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<p>The new album art would automatically reflect in every other place it has been published in amuzzin.</p>

<h4>More details on your song, more popular you are in amuzzin</h4>

<p>So you changed your Song with a nice Album Art, but more details about your song would help your Music fans find you in their search more easily.</p>

<p>In the second column you can Edit the Genre,Language,Year. You can add complete <strong>Lyrics</strong> of the Song which might help the next level music listeners who would listen music along with the lyrics of the song.</p>

<h4>I am an artist and I need my profile WITH MY PHOTO</h4>

<p>Previously there is no way in amuzzin to edit your Profile photo. We have either extracted your photo from Facebook or from Gravatar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;coz we thought amuzzin would be more of adding new music by an artist, than updating their profile every hour with a photo which they might have took on the parkside (ofcourse with vintage filter applied).</p>

<p>But since few artists are confused about changing their identity in Gravatar or Facebook services we decided to allow <strong>Edit Profile Photo</strong> within amuzzin, from where they can update their profile photo.</p>

<p>This would appear on either viewing your own Profile or clicking on the Dropdown at top right corner.</p>
